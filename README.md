Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript

As a full-stack Web Developer, I worked on the GitHub Finder Tool.
It features two views:
1- Profile View (with a cloned design from GitHub).
2- Comparison View.
The tool allows users to search for usernames, displays profile details, and determines a winner based on tow criteria(#repos then #followers)

My contributions to this project encompassed:
‚ú® Cloning the UI components for both the profile and comparison views.
‚ú® Ensuring responsiveness across all screen sizes for an optimal user experience.
‚ú® Fetching data from the API and seamlessly displaying it within the UI components.
‚ú® Implementing the logic precisely as per the project requirements.
